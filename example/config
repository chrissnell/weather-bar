; If you have a Weather Underground API key, provide it here.  When you provide an API key here,
; weather-bar will use the WU API instead of NOAA, which enables much more weather detail and more
; frequent weather updates.
;
; If you don't yet have an API key, you can sign up for their **free** "Stratus" plan, which gives
; you 500 queries per day.   https://www.wunderground.com/api
; weather-underground-api-key = "YOUR-API-KEY-HERE"

; By default, noaa-weather-bar will attempt to geolocate you and determine the nearest NOAA weather station
; based on this location.  If the geolocation is failing or inaccurate, you can override it by providing a
; latitude and longitude (in +/- DD.dddddd format) or a NOAA station ID here.
; 
; To hardcode a latitude/longitude, uncomment the following:
; latitude = 39.17851
; longitude = -96.63765
;
; To hardcode a specific ICAO or WU PWS weather station, uncomment the following:
; station = "KMHK"
; station = "KTXALAMO5"
